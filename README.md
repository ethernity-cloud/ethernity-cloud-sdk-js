## Installation

To install the package and its dependencies, run:

```sh
npm install ethernity-cloud-sdk-js
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the provided scripts to build, publish, and initialize your project.

## Pre-requisites
The sdk requires the following to be installed on your system:
- Node.js v20.04 or higher
- npm
- docker (daemon running in the background for build and publish scripts)


## Operating System compatibility
The sdk has been tested on the following operating systems:
- MacOS
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Windows 10

## Blockchain compatibility

    - Testnet - tested and working
    - Mainnet - to be provided during the following updates
- Polyhon:
    - Amoy Testnet - to be provided during the following updates
    - Mainnet - to be provided during the following updates

### Scripts

- **Initialize**: To initialize the project, run:
  ```sh
  npm run ecld-init
  ```
  at this step, all the initial configurations will be set up and the project will be ready to be built, published and run.

- **Build**: To build the project, run:
  ```sh
  npm run ecld-build
  ```
    the project will be built and the docker repository output will be stored in the `registry/` directory. This is the stage where the backend functions are added to the secure images.

- **Publish**: To publish the project, run:
  ```sh
  npm run ecld-publish
  ```
  Required after build, to build and integrate the secure certificates that will be used during executions and to register the project to the Ethernity Cloud Image Register.

- **Test (local, no chain)**: To run your backend locally with the enclave's own
  executor — no SGX, no gas, instant — run:
  ```sh
  npx ecld-test 'hello("World")'
  npx ecld-test --file payload.js
  npx ecld-test --input data.json 'processData(___etny_data_set___)'
  ```
  This validates the *call* (function names, arguments, result wiring) before a
  single on-chain request is paid for. If your dApp uses ESR (Enclave State
  Registry), state is emulated locally and **on by default**: `require('../ecld_state').StateRegistry`
  get/commit, ownership/ACL, and `taskCaller()` all work in-process against an
  in-memory registry, and persist between runs in `.ecld-esr-local.*.json`. The
  task caller defaults to your developer address; override it with `--caller`.
  `npx ecld-test serve` starts a local API so the runner's LOCAL mode drives your
  real integration end to end. Exit code 0 on `SUCCESS`, 1 otherwise.

- **Run (on the network)**: To submit a payload to the network and print the
  decrypted result, run:
  ```sh
  npx ecld-run 'hello("World")'
  npx ecld-run --file payload.js
  npx ecld-run --input data.json 'processData(___etny_data_set___)'
  npx ecld-run --json 'esrIncrement()'
  ```
  This is the network-side sibling of `ecld-test`: instead of executing locally
  it drives the runner end to end — encrypt → IPFS → on-chain request → wait for
  a node → download and decrypt the result. It **costs gas and needs a funded
  key**. Network and enclaves come from `.env` (`BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK`,
  `PROJECT_NAME`, `TRUSTED_ZONE_IMAGE`), overridable with
  `--network`/`--securelock`/`--trustedzone`; the signing key is `PRIVATE_KEY`
  (or `ECLD_PRIVATE_KEY`) — a funded `0x` key that pays for the order. Resources
  are tunable with `--task-price`/`--cpu`/`--memory`/`--storage`/`--bandwidth`/`--duration`/`--validators`.
  Exit code 0 on a `SUCCESS` task result, 1 otherwise.

- **Inspect (read-only)**: To read enclave and on-chain diagnostics — network,
  trustedzone/securelock registration, and ESR state — without spending gas, run:
  ```sh
  npx ecld-info
  npx ecld-info esr state <key>
  ```

## Usage

To use the SDK:
- after installation, run `npm run ecld-init` to initialize the project
- in you workspace, you will find the `scr/serverless` directory, this contains a `backend.js` file. This file will be imported in the dApp images to provide the backend functions for calling from the frontend of your application, eg.:
```js
function hello(msg='World') {
    return "Hello "+msg;
}

module.exports = { hello };
```
From your frontend application, using the ethernity cloud runner library, you will be calling the function as seen in the below example, where we pass `hello("World");` to be executed on the backend which will run in the Blockchain:
```js
const AppCss = require('./App.css');
import EthernityCloudRunner from "@ethernity-cloud/runner";
import {ECEvent, ECRunner, ECStatus} from "@ethernity-cloud/runner/enums";
import Web3 from 'web3';

const PROJECT_NAME = "";
const IPFS_ENDPOINT = "";

const code = `hello("World");`;

function App() {
    const executeTask = async () => {
        const runner = new EthernityCloudRunner();
        // this is a server provided by Ethernity CLOUD, please bear in mind that you can use your own Decentralized Storage server
        const ipfsAddress = IPFS_ENDPOINT;
        runner.initializeStorage(ipfsAddress);
        console.log(PROJECT_NAME)
        const onTaskProgress = (e) => {
            if (e.detail.status === ECStatus.ERROR) {
                console.error(e.detail.message);
            } else {
                console.log(e.detail.message);
            }
        };

        const onTaskCompleted = (e) => {
            console.log(`Task Result: ${e.detail.message.result}`);
            // display the result in page below the buttons
            const result = document.createElement("p");
            result.innerHTML = `Task Result: ${e.detail.message.result}`;
            document.body.appendChild(result);
        }

        runner.addEventListener(ECEvent.TASK_PROGRESS, onTaskProgress);
        runner.addEventListener(ECEvent.TASK_COMPLETED, onTaskCompleted);

        await runner.run(PROJECT_NAME,
                        code,
                         '',
                         { taskPrice: 10, cpu: 1, memory: 1, storage: 10, bandwidth: 1, duration: 1, validators: 1 });
    };
    const connectWallet = async () => {
      if (window.ethereum) {
          window.web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
          try {
              // Request account access
              await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
              console.log("Wallet connected");
          } catch (error) {
              console.error("User denied account access");
          }
      } else {
          console.log('Please install MetaMask!');
      }
  };

    return (
        <div className="container">
            <button className="centeredButton" onClick={executeTask}>Execute Task</button>
            <button className="centeredButton" onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>
        </div>
    );
}
export default App;
```
- you are able to define the functions needed to be used in the backend, while making sure that the function that is script is compilable and that it exports the function that will be called from the frontend, in the above example, the `hello` function.
