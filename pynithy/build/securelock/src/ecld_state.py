"""Enclave State Registry (ESR) — in-enclave state API.

Gives payload code durable, encrypted state across tasks:

    from ecld_state import StateRegistry

    state = StateRegistry()
    data = state.get("my-key")                    # {} the first time
    state.commit("my-key", lambda s: {**s, "n": s.get("n", 0) + 1})

State is encrypted inside the enclave, stored as an IPFS object, and only a
POINTER (the CID) plus a version goes on-chain. The registry contract keeps one
entry per (enclave, key) with monotonic versions and optimistic concurrency.

## Why the enclave computes the CID itself

The node is untrusted. If it told the enclave which CID to commit, a malicious
operator could pin the enclave's blob but return the CID of DIFFERENT content;
the enclave would sign that onto the chain, and clients would fetch
attacker-chosen state believing the enclave authored it.

A CID is a hash of the content, so the enclave derives it from the bytes it just
encrypted (CIDv1/raw = base32(0x01 0x55 0x12 0x20 || sha256(content))) and
commits that. The node pins and verifies but never chooses. A hostile node can
refuse to pin or pin something else, yet cannot change what was committed:
substitution is impossible rather than merely detectable.

It also means the enclave never waits on the node — it writes the blob, writes
the CID, commits, and moves on. Pinning is fire-and-forget.

## Encryption

State is encrypted with a key derived from the enclave identity under a SECOND
domain separator (distinct from the ESR wallet's), so the state key cannot
collide with the wallet key. State therefore inherits exactly the identity's
security: on mainnet it is CAS-provisioned and enclave-only; on testnet the
identity is reproducible, so state there is readable by anyone who can reproduce
it. That is the accepted testnet posture — functional testing, not secrecy.

SECURITY: the state encryption key and the wallet key never leave this module.
Only the address and the CID are ever emitted.
