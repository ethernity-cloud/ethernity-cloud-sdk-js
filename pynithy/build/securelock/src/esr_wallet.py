"""ESR identity wallet derivation (ESR RFC §5.1).

The enclave's Ethereum wallet is derived from the enclave's IDENTITY PRIVATE
KEY (the cert key), never from MR_ENCLAVE:

    eth_priv    = keccak256(DOMAIN_SEP || identity_priv_der)   # secp256k1 scalar
    eth_address = address(secp256k1(eth_priv))

Why derive instead of reusing the cert key: the cert is secp384r1 (P-384) and
Ethereum signing requires secp256k1, so a P-384 key can never sign a
transaction. Deriving from the identity key means the wallet inherits the
identity's security properties automatically:

  * mainnet — identity key is the CAS-provisioned secret, so the wallet is
    enclave-only and stable across every node running this MRENCLAVE.
  * testnet — identity key is derived from MR_SIGNER/MR_ENCLAVE, both PUBLIC,
    so the wallet is public too. Functional testing only; is_secret_identity()
    reports False and callers must warn loudly (RFC §7).

DOMAIN_SEP keeps this key from colliding with any other use of the identity
key; a second separator derives the state-encryption key in a later phase.

SECURITY: nothing here may serialize, log or return the private key. The only
value that ever leaves the enclave is the ADDRESS (RFC §5.2) — that is what
makes the wallet fundable and readable without weakening secrecy.

    """True only when the identity key is genuinely unpredictable to outsiders.

    `attested` is whether this build is provisioned by a CAS (its key comes
    from the CAS session): true on mainnet and on a testnet whose enclaves are
    attested by the ethernity-cas validator set.

    This is NOT "is the enclave genuine" — SGX protects enclave memory on every
    network. It is the narrower question the ESR wallet depends on: could
    someone outside the enclave reproduce the private key?

    The distinction is ATTESTATION, not SGX. Both networks run the identical
    in-enclave generator (get_sgx_report.c) on real SGX hardware, so at runtime
    a node operator cannot read the key out of enclave memory on either.

      * mainnet — CAS attests the enclave (DCAP quote verified) before the
        identity is trusted, so a key is only accepted from a genuine, measured
        enclave. The private key is effectively enclave-only: reproducing the
        derivation outside a real attested enclave yields a key nothing accepts.
        Intended posture; needs nothing from ESR.
      * testnet — NO attestation. The enclave still runs on SGX and still
        generates the keypair with the same algorithm, but nothing verifies the
        MRENCLAVE, and the derivation input (MR_ENCLAVE) is public. So anyone
        who rebuilds the image can reproduce the keypair. This is a deliberate
        testnet tradeoff (real enclave execution for functional testing without
        the CAS dependency) — not a bug. Treat testnet ESR wallets as
        disposable; do not fund them with real value.

    What would make the testnet key genuinely exclusive is a secret INPUT that
    never leaves the CPU (EGETKEY / sealing key) OR requiring attestation on
    testnet too. Encrypting or obfuscating the generator does NOT achieve this:
    without attestation, an attacker doesn't reverse the code — they run the
    published image (it is on IPFS, MRENCLAVE on-chain) and observe the key.
